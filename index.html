                        <p>We are committed to uplifting Black communities worldwide by creating fair, meaningful work both in the UK and in the regions where our stories come from, including the Caribbean and across Africa. We work directly with writers, artists, historians, and designers from these communities and ensure that all contributors are paid fairly and transparently. Where possible, contributors are offered clear pathways into long-term employment. Our employees are treated as partners in the company's success, with shares reserved for staff and pay structured to be genuinely fair. The highest-paid role in the company will never earn more than three times the lowest-paid employee. We believe that ethical storytelling must be matched by ethical business practice.</p>

                        <p>The stories we tell are rooted in land, people, and history, and our production reflects that responsibility. As part of this, we recognise that the Global South will be more disproportionately affected by climate change. Our games are made using plastic-free, recyclable, and responsibly sourced materials, with a focus on natural options such as paper and cardboard. Organic and sustainable inputs are prioritised, and materials that compromise recyclability are avoided. We aim to reduce our environmental impact through low-carbon shipping and thoughtful distribution. Honouring culture also means protecting the environment that sustains it.</p>
